# Class-Exam-Grade-Statistics

GUI program made on Visual Studio and VB.net w/ importing files.

The program reads in a .txt file or .log file from the user's computer and the program splits each grade based on the number into the Letter Category to display the class grades. It is also displayed what the highest and lowest score are along with percentages of the readable file to see how many students are above the average of the class.

The program also displays in an increment counter how many students have failed and how many have passed the class or test.

The user is also able to import other .txt files and .log files at their leisure to see other classes statistics and can compare percentages with 2 or more classes.
